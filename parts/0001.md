# The Position Struct
The Position struct contains all the information about the game state. This includes: piece locations, the side to move, the half move counter, the full move counter, castling permissions, and en passant status.

---

## Piece Locations
Various options exist. While bitboards are perhaps the most popular and fastest, we are instead going to go with the most natural representation: an 8x8 grid.

---

## Side To Move
A simple enum will store whose turn it is to move.

---

## Halfmoves
The half move counter stores the number of ply since the last irreversible move.

---

## Fullmoves
The full move counter stores how many moves have been played in the game. A full move is equal to two ply. This information is not strictly necessary.

---

## En passant
Store the square to potentially move to with en passant, even though such a move may not currently be legal. For example, after the move `1. e4` the ep square will be set to `e3`.

---

## Castling
Four different castling moves exist: white kingside, white queenside, black kingside, and black queenside. Castling permissions store which of these moves can still be performed. However, the permission being true does not mean that the relevant move is currently legal on the board, it only tells us that the move can be played should the rules of chess allow it. If the relevant king or rook move, or should the rook be captured, then the relevant flag becomes false.
